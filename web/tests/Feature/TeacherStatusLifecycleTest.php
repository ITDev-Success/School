 * TeacherStatusLifecycleTest

 * - Active teacher can login successfully
 * - Same teacher with inactive status cannot login
 * - Same teacher with exit status cannot login
 * - Teacher data persists after status changes (for historical records)
 *
 * This test demonstrates that users are never deleted from the system,
 * only their status changes to prevent future logins while preserving
 * historical data (marks, feedback, attendance records, etc.).
